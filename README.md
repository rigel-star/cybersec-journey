# Cybersecurity Systems & Networking Lab

A collection of small programs written while studying a self‑curated cybersecurity path, mainly focused on low‑level systems programming (syscalls, OS behavior) and basic networking concepts.

This repository acts as a personal practice space and code log while learning how software interacts with the operating system and network stack from a security perspective.

Most programs are minimal, experimental, and intended for local Unix(or mainly MacOS) environments.
