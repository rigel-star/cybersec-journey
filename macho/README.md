# Mach-O Exploration Lab

A collection of small programs and notes created while exploring the Mach-O executable file format and its internal structures.

The focus is on understanding how macOS binaries are organized, loaded, and linked at a low level from a systems and reverse‑engineering perspective.

Most code is minimal, experimental, and intended for local analysis environments.
